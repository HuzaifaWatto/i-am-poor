# i-am-poor
This is a simple iOS app created as part of a challenge project in the iOS 12 App Development Course. The app humorously contrasts with the "I Am Rich" app by displaying a message and image symbolizing poverty.

I used UIKit to build this app, focusing on handling basic UI components like labels and images, as well as learning to work with constraints and layout using storyboards.
